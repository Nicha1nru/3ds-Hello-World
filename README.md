You need a modded 3ds with homebrew to run this.

# How to run it:
Assuming you already have a 3DS which can run homebrew applications, put both the .3dsx and the .smhd file in your 3DS SD card (Make sure to put it in the homebrew folder.), after that you simply open the homebrew app and run helloworld.
